*                   ---Traveling Salesman Problem---
*   A sus salesman is looking for the most efficient way to traveleing 
*   door to door to sell his products. The places are selected are 
*   selected at random and the algorithm must be able to differentiate
*   the distance between each point. Finding the shortest distance 
*   from each point. 
*
*                           ---Execution---
*   With the rise of parallel computing such as the Cuda cores, finding
*   the most shortest length between points become easier. The 
*   development of finding the differrent distances while calculating
*   the length of the most efficient route could be done in mere seconds
*
*                   ---Program Rules (boundries)---
*   This is an example of the CUDA and it's capabilities to solve this problem
*   so basic rules must consists of 
*   - execution of basic CUDA C++ Functions
*   - must be able to render in
